# Homework Part 1: Responsibility
#### Drew Guarnera & Heather Michaud

Project A and B Part 1 was a close collaboration between its two project team
members. Majority of the testing plan content was written while both members of
the team discussed the task of providing acceptance testing (NYPL) and viability
testing (TinyDB) within the scope of the two projects. Each idea for the
methodology and plan was derived from personal work experience, previous
development experience, and the content of the software testing course for which
this project is assigned. The other remaining parts of the project, single test
prototypes and requirements were done in a similar fashion but with significant
starting contributions from the team members as stated below.

### Drew
- Development of test prototypes for Part1 B
- Requirements for Part1 A

### Heather
- Development of test prototypes for Part1 A
- Requirements for Part1 B
