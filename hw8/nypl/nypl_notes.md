In testing, found that

* a search by keyword new NYPL revealed less results than old NYPL (see hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy)
* searching by ISBN in new NYPL revealed more than one result in some cases (see 1451673310 for fahrenheit 451). to mitigate, checked that results were less than 5. expected ISBN to be unique.
* searching by title (Harry Potter) and location (Tompkins Square), new NYPL had less results (25) than old NYPL (30)
* can view location - use ISBN of HHGTTG and found that the old catalog had a copy of it at the Ottendorfer Fiction library, but the new catalog had all of the location listings but this one.
