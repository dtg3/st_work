In testing, found that

* a search by keyword new NYPL revealed less results than old NYPL (see hithhiker's guide to the galaxy)
* searching by ISBN in new NYPL revealed more than one result in some cases (see 1451673310 for fahrenheit 451). to mitigate, checked that results were less than 5. expected ISBN to be unique.
* searching by title (Harry Potter) and location (Tompkins Square), new NYPL had less results (25) than old NYPL (30)
